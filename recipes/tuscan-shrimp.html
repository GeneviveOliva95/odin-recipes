<!--This section is part of the ingredients list-->
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 small shallot, diced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, softened in water according to package instructions, drained, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
            <li>Parsley, chopped for garnish</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season shrimp evenly with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>To a large skillet over medium-high heat, add oil. Once hot, add shrimp and cook about 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer the cooked shrimp to a plate and tent to keep warm. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add butter. Once melted, add shallots and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook until the shallots are softened (2-4 minutes). Add garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Sprinkle flour over the top and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add heavy cream, parmesan cheese, and cherry tomatoes. Stir to combine, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan as you go.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low. Simmer until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce has thickened slightly, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add spinach and stir to combine. Cook for 2-3 more minutes, or until the spinach is wilted.</li>
            <li>Top with cooked shrimp. Serve immediately garnished with parsley and extra parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
