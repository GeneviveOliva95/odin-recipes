        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Bolognese is a classic Italian meat-based sauce consisting of <em>finely</em> chopped beef or veal cooked with onions, carrots, tomatoes, celery, and wine or milk depending on preference. It is commonly used as a topping for pasta dishes such as tagliatelle or spaghetti.</p>

        <p>Bolognese sauce is known for its <em>savory</em> and <strong>bold</strong> flavors. The slow cooking process allows the ingredients to meld together, creating a depth of flavor that is both hearty and satisfying. The combination of meat, vegetables, tomatoes, and herbs results in a balanced sauce that is both <em>flavorful</em> and <em>aromatic</em>. Additionally, the addition of wine or milk can add a subtle sweetness and creaminess to the overall taste profile.</p>
