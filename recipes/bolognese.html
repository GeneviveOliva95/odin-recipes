        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bolognese is a classic Italian meat-based sauce consisting of <em>finely</em> chopped beef or veal cooked with onions, carrots, tomatoes, celery, and wine or milk depending on preference. It is commonly used as a topping for pasta dishes such as tagliatelle or spaghetti.</p>

        <p>Bolognese sauce is known for its <em>savory</em> and <strong>bold</strong> flavors. The slow cooking process allows the ingredients to meld together, creating a depth of flavor that is both hearty and satisfying. The combination of meat, vegetables, tomatoes, and herbs results in a balanced sauce that is both <em>flavorful</em> and <em>aromatic</em>. Additionally, the addition of wine or milk can add a subtle sweetness and creaminess to the overall taste profile.</p>

        <h4>To Serve</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>400 g / 13 oz spaghetti, dried</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese and finely chopped parsley (optional)</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
            <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 to 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 to 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
            <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti to though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
        </ol>
